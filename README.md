# Trivia game project

## Introduction
This project was made during week 3 of Ironhack's fullstack development bootcamp. Each of us has one week (well, 4 days exactly) to work on a game project on our own. This was to apply the concepts learned during the first two weeks, which were teaching us front-end development: HTML & CSS, DOM manipulation, JavaScript for front-end purposes...

## Setup
If you'd like to test my project in your browser while it isn't online:
- in your terminal : ``` git clone https://github.com/zelumine/ironhack-trivia-game-project.git ```
- ```cd ironhack-trivia-game-project ```
- ```open index.html``` OR ```lite-server```

## Team Members
This was a solo exercice but I had a little bit of guidance from my lovely teacher and TAs!
